# Multi-Thread-Word-Counter
A word counting program written in Java that counts words from a directory across multiple files 

This program is written with the purpose of showing the difference in speed between multithreaded solutions and singlethreaded solutions. 
In a problem like word counting from multiple files, everything from fetching the files to parsing them, to counting the words becomes much faster by using a multi-threaded approach.
